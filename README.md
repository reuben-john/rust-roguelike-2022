# rust-roguelike-2022

This is a learning roguelike I am building in Rust.

I'm working through the book "Hands on Rust" and this repo will contain all the dungeoncrawl sections of code.

This work also runs along with [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/)'s "RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial"
